# AVOID FREQUENCIES

- 100-150 mHZ
- 450-500 mHZ
- 800 mHZ

# search

- flex radio tutorials
- ft8 noise reduction algorithms

# I/Q sampling

i + q = amplitude + phase modulation (basically a 2-vector)
time domain = floats = what a modem does
when it comes to I/Q, we're looking for frequency domain
if you want to convert time to frequency domain you need FFT

# groundwave vs skywave

wifi groundwave signals just go straight through ionosphere and out into space, can't bounce and propagate off of the atmosphere

## 3khz-3mhz = medium-wave (counts as skywave)

- includes AM radio (.5 - 7 mhz)
- during the day there's a lot of attenuation
- bumper to bumper for 50 years, no available bandwidth


## 3mhz - 30 mhgz = FM

- shortwave
- periods of 5-6 years of the solar cycle where there's no skywave propagation at all
- 


## 30 - 300mhz = VHF

- TV stations 2 - 13
- air traffic stuff
- fire departments
- some police departments
- military stuff

above that is pure groundwave line of sight

## 300mhz - 1ghz = UHF

- police
- used to be old analog cell phones (900mhz)

above that is microwave



# antennas

- each 3db is double the gain
- if you cut an omni into a half sphere you gain 3db
to get 30mi
- omni way up in the air
- beam antenna
